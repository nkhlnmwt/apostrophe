# Nunjucks 2.x: long term maintenance fork

This fork of Nunjucks 2.x is maintained by the ApostropheCMS team
as part of long term support for ApostropheCMS 2.x. There will be
no new features or intentional changes in behavior. We recommend
the latest version of the mainstream Nunjucks release for new
projects, and plan to use that in future versions of ApostropheCMS
that require a templating language.

Our maintenance modifications, if any, are released under the same
license as Nunjucks 2.x.
